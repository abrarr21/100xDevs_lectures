In this test,
Mocking a database in unit testing with Vitest means creating a fake or simulated version of the database to isolate the part of your code being tested.

in the index.ts
prismaClient.request.create({}) is called

vitest will run the simulation like
{ prismaClient: { request: { create: vi.fn()}}}

vi.fn() is like a empty function or think it like this function gets ignored while testing.

for deep mocking -> create **mocks** folder where db.ts file exists.
